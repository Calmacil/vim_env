This repository contains my major VIM configurations.
You should be aware of the fact that this configuration is optimized for the FR-BÉPO keyboard layout.

Installation:

    git clone git://github.com/Calmacil/vim_env.git your/vim/envs/directory
    ln -s your/vim/envs/directory/env_name ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc .vimrc

Except for the “default” environnement, you should cd in each dir and follow
its README instructions.
